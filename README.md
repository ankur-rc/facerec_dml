### Introduction
“Face Trigger” (FT) is a *framework* for building applications that rely on **face-recognition**. It enables the development of an end-to-end pipeline for training a machine learning classifier for the purposes of identifying people’s faces.

### Pipeline

 1. **Obtain images representing the faces of individuals.**
	 - Face Trigger preprocesses individual images to find a face within the image. It rejects images that are unfit for use.
 2. **Augment the dataset**
	 - It is recommended to obtain atleast 10 images per subject. However, if such a scenario is not possible, Face Trigger can create artificial samples from existing images to create a 10-core dataset.
 3. **Training Phase 1: Deep Face Embeddings** 
	 - Face Trigger runs through the dataset to extract the embeddings from each image. These embeddings are generated by a deep neural network based on a similar architecture as described in [FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832) 
 4. **Training Phase 2: Calibrated Support Vector Classifier**
	- We train a calibrated Support Vector Classifier on the embeddings. This classifier is capable of generating probability measures for each embedding fed to it as belonging to one of the subjects.
 5. **Threshold**
	 - The probability measures from the SVC is thresholded - measures less than the threshold are rejected to belong to an unknown subject.
