========================================

Face Trigger
------------

   A framework for face-recognition based applications.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Face Trigger” (FT) is a *framework* for building applications that rely
on **face-recognition**. It enables the development of an end-to-end
pipeline for training a machine learning classifier for the purposes of
identifying people’s faces.

Pipeline
~~~~~~~~

1. **Obtain images representing the faces of individuals.**

   -  Face Trigger preprocesses individual images to find a face within
      the image. It rejects images that are unfit for use.

2. **Augment the dataset**

   -  It is recommended to obtain atleast 10 images per subject.
      However, if such a scenario is not possible, Face Trigger can
      create artificial samples from existing images to create a 10-core
      dataset.

3. **Training Phase 1: Deep Face Embeddings**

   -  Face Trigger runs through the dataset to extract the embeddings
      from each image. These embeddings are generated by a deep neural
      network based on a similar architecture as described in `FaceNet:
      A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering`_

4. **Training Phase 2: Calibrated Support Vector Classifier**

   -  We train a calibrated Support Vector Classifier on the embeddings.
      This classifier is capable of generating probability measures for
      each embedding fed to it as belonging to one of the subjects.

5. **Threshold**

   -  The probability measures from the SVC is thresholded - measures
      less than the threshold are rejected to belong to an unknown
      subject.
